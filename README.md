### This is a simple portfolio page for Jake St. Germain!

### Description
This page serves as a home page for Jake St. Germain. Here you will find information regarding yours truly as well as some of my thoughts and experiences. The goal
of this page is showcase my skills as a web-developer through project showcases and because this site has been hand coded by me! You will also find ways to contact me via social media or via email.

### Special Instructions
- The functionality of blog page is currently limited. Posts do not save to a data base and are lost when the page reloads. I intend to work on this site feature in the future!

### Features:
- Navigation menu that hides away in mobile view and is visible in desktop browser. The menu can be summoned in mobile by clicking the icon in the upper right corner of the page.
- Static side bar that does not move when scrolling through the page on desktop view.
- Combination of CSS Flexbox and floats to make the site behave in an appealing manor when changing browser size.
- Discrete animations placed on navigation bar.
- The CSS is grouped in such a way to make theme changes easier.
- The ability to post to the Blog page. The ability to input a title, author name, and post body into text fields and display it as a post. All fields must be filled in to post.
- Other, smaller projects linked in the Project page.
- Some images are loaded from a self-made sprite sheet to make site loading easier.
