###This is a simple portfolio page for Jake St. Germain!

###Features:
Navigation menu that hides away in mobile view and is visible in desktop browser. The menu can be summoned in mobile by clicking the icon in the upper right corner of the page.
Static side bar that does not move when scrolling through the page on desktop view.
Combination of CSS Flexbox and floats to make the site behave in an appealing manor when changing browser size.
Discrete animations placed on navigation bar.
“:nth-child” or “nth-of-type” was used to style a series of elements on the pages.
The CSS is grouped in such a way to make theme changes easier.
(planned) The ability to post to the Blog page using HTML forms and JS. The ability to input a title, poster name, and post body into text fields and display it as a post.
(planned) Other projects linked in the Project page that perform other JS functions.
    (WIP)Sad Libs - play on the Mad Libs game that will allow users to input words into text fields that will be displayed in a paragraph.
    (WIP)Daft Punk Soundboard - A soundboard that allows users to click/touch buttons on the screen and produce audio.
    (WIP)Med Calc - Medical formulas that will allow the user to input vital signs, lab results, and other clinical findings to determine patient outcomes (mean arterial pressure, mean airway pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, and oxygenation index are planned).
